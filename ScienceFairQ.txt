Question To Test:
How does the programming language effect how fast a command can be processed?

Languages to test:
C
Python 3.5.3
C#
Perl

Hypothesis To Test:
I predict that C will be able to process the command the fastest becuase it is one of the languages that are used to create operating system kernels.
And because it is rather old therfore giving it more possible time for its compilers to be optimized for faster outputed code.

How can this impact the real world (Purpose):
With this imformation, people can use it to create programs that run more effectivly. There for, allowing bigger programs to be created to
process more information and solve more and more complex problems, like Self Learning Artificial Inteligence (S.L.A.I.).

Program ideas/Notes:
Program to find prime numbers (Because it needs processing power)
Perl comes with it's own IDE
C#.NET Compile on windows only
C is compiled with VS CL
